## Mathematical Educational Papers and Conjectures

**NOTE:** Some of the papers are written in ${\LaTeX}$ and others are written in ${\TeX}$.

(The ${\TeX}$ papers have an "input macro" statement at the beginning of their files.)

In any event the corresponding pdf's are in the directory **pdf/**.

### Pythagorean Triples
- Alternative Proof of an elementary Property of Primitive Pythagorean Triples: **tex**/prop_pythag_triple.tex.
- Conjectures regarding Primitive Pythagorean Triples: **tex**/conj_pythag_triple.tex.
- Julia code supporting the Pythagorean triples conjecture via a Jupyter notebook: **src**/pythag.ipynb.

### Math Education
- The Essentials of Calculus (Discrete and Continuous): **pdf**/essential_calculus.pdf.
    - Provides a view connecting the continuous Calculus with the Discrete Calculus.
    - In addition, it connects differential equations with difference equations.
- What is a Derivative: **tex**/what_is_a_derivative.tex.
    - This is such an important idea, but viewing it in the right way can bring
       fantastic generalizations.
- What is the Determinant: **tex**/what_is_a_determinant.tex.
    - This is almost always introduced by the formula rather than what it means.
- Why is Matrix Multiplication the way it is: **tex**/why_matrix_mult.tex.
    - We motivate this by solving the natural generalization of: $$a * x = b$$.
- Where does the "dot-product" come from: **tex**/inner_prod_from_projection.tex.
    - We give an alternative derivation of the dot product and how its generalization
      can be seen as a kind of software factorization.
- Examination of a Dice throwing problem using Measure Theoretic Conditional Expectation: **tex**/conditional_expectation_simple.tex.
    - Gain a better understanding of Measure Theory via a discrete setting.
- Defining Fractal Dimension. 
    - Provides an intuitive sense with examples of the definition of *Fractal Dimension*: **tex**/fractal_dim.tex.
- Re-Examination of a Linear Unbiased Estimation Problem with different Norms: **tex**/prob_linear_unbias_est.tex.
    - Regardless of norm we get the same unbiased estimate.
- A Balance Law approach to the derivation of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations: **tex**/heat_balance.tex.
    - Often partial differential equations can be derived from simple balance laws.
- A derivation of the Exponential Moving Average and its associated moving Standard Deviation: **tex**/exponential_moving_average.tex.
    - Associated un-biased estimates of the moments of the exponential moving average are also given.

### New Mathematical Formulas
- A formula to Compute Probability Distributions for Singular Transformations: **tex**/prob_singular_trans.tex.
    - There is a standard formula when computing the probability distribution for
      non-singular transformations. However, when it comes to singular transformations of the form: ${f: R^n \rightarrow R^m}$
      with ${m < n}$ there are only add-hoc procedures. In this paper we provide a systematic way to compute
      the probability distributions for such singular transformations.
