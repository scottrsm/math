\section{Introduction}
When I was a freshmen in college I was briefly interested in the idea of 
using the areas of geometric figures to
produce interesting formulas. The example that inspired me was the way you 
can derive the Pythagorean formula
by examining the area of a square sliced into a few pieces.

I tried to do something similar with a more complicated geometric figure and 
I came up with figure $(\ref{fig:geo})$.

By inscribing a circle in a right triangle, one can decompose the triangle 
into two pairs of right triangles and a square. The fact that the sub-triangles
are right triangles follows using the fact that 
any radial segment of a circle is perpendicular to its
associated tangent line.

Below we find a well known relation between the sides, $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the
original triangle using the fact that the area of these component triangles 
and square must be the same as the area of the original triangle. 

\section{A Basic Property of Primitive Pythagorean Triples}
Writing the equivalence of the area of the figure and its parts we have:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \overbrace{\vphantom{\frac{X^1}{X}}r^2}^{\text{Square}} 
    + \overbrace{2 \frac{r(a - r)}{2}}^{\text{Two lower triangles}} 
    + \overbrace{2 \frac{r(b-r)}{2}}^{\text{Two upper triangles}}  
    &=& \overbrace{\frac{a\, b}{2}}^{\text{Original triangle}}  
\end{eqnarray}

Simplifying, this is:
\begin{eqnarray}
r^2 + r(a - r) + r(b-r) = \frac{a\, b}{2} \label{area} 
\end{eqnarray}

One can solve the quadratic for $r$ or read off from the figure 
that $(a-r) + (b-r) = c$. Solving this last equation for $r$ gives:
\begin{eqnarray}
  r & = & \frac{a + b - c}{2} \label{radius}
\end{eqnarray}

We now consider primitive Pythagorean triangles -- right 
triangles with integer sides which have no common factor.
In particular, we are interested in so-called primitive Pythagorean triples,
$(a,b,c)$ -- the lengths of the sides of primitive Pythagorean triangles.

What can we say about the even or oddness of the sides when the sides have no 
common factors? 

Since we know that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, we can reduce the combinations to 
the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{$c$ is even AND both $a$ and $b$ are odd;}
  \item{$c$ is odd AND one and only one of either $a$ or $b$ is odd.}
\end{itemize}

Regardless of which choice occurs, equation $(\ref{radius})$ implies that 
the radius of the circle is an integer.%
\footnote{We list a few facts to explain this and what follows next:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{$E \pm E = E$;}
    \item{$E \pm O = O$;}
    \item{$O \pm O = E$;}
    \item{$E \times E = E$;}
    \item{$O \times O = O$;}
    \item{$E \times O = E$.}
\end{enumerate}
These equations are to be read: An even number plus (or minus) and even number 
is an even number.
Likewise, an even number plus (or minus) an odd number is an even number, etc.}

Using this fact and equation $(\ref{area})$ we see that the quantity, 
$\frac{a \, b}{2}$, must be an integer. 
This knowledge eliminates the first choice; namely, that both $a$ and $b$ 
are odd. Consequently, one of the sides
is even. Let's say that it is $b$.% 
\footnote{This follows from the following fact:
if ${\rm gcd}(x, a) = 1$, AND $x$ divides the product $a\, b$, then
$x$ divides $b$. We apply this fact with $x$ set to $2$.}

Finally, regardless of whether $r$ is even or odd, the left hand side of 
$(\ref{area})$ is even. This implies that $\frac{a \, b}{2}$
is even. Again since, $a$ is odd, $b/2$ must be divisible by $2$.

Finally, we have deduced the properties below for primitive Pythagorean triples, 
$(a,b,c)$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item{One of the legs is odd; the other leg is even; and the hypotenuse 
      is odd.}
  \item{The even leg is divisible by $4$.}
\end{itemize}
