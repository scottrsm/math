\section{Introduction}
When I was a freshmen in college I was briefly interested in the idea of 
using the areas of geometric figures to
produce interesting formulas. The example that inspired me was the way one 
can derive the Pythagorean formula
by examining a dissected rectangle composed of 
an inscribed square and triangles. 

I tried to do something similar with a more complicated geometric figure and 
I came up with figure $(\ref{fig:geo})$.

By inscribing a circle in a {\em right\/} triangle, one can decompose the triangle 
into two pairs of right triangles and a square. The fact that the sub-triangles
are right triangles follows using the fact that 
any radial segment of a circle is perpendicular to its
associated tangent line. 

From the figure, the lower right four sided sub-figure has equal sides, $r$.
It is a square and not a rhombus as we 
see that three of its interior angles are 
$90^\circ$; and, as the number of angles in a 4 sided convex polygon must sum to 
$360^\circ$, the last angle must also be $90^\circ$.
Consequently, the four sided figure is a square.

Below we find a well known relation between the sides, $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the
original triangle when the sides are integers in reduced form.
This is done by investigating the fact that the area of these component triangles 
and square must be the same as the area of the original triangle. 

\section{A Basic Property of Primitive Pythagorean Triples}
Writing the equivalence of the area of the figure and its parts we have:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \overbrace{\vphantom{\frac{X^1}{X}}r^2}^{\text{Square}} 
    + \overbrace{2 \frac{r(a - r)}{2}}^{\text{Two lower triangles}} 
    + \overbrace{2 \frac{r(b-r)}{2}}^{\text{Two upper triangles}}  
    &=& \overbrace{\frac{a\, b}{2}}^{\text{Original triangle}}  
\end{eqnarray}

Simplifying, this is:
\begin{eqnarray}
r^2 + r(a - r) + r(b-r) = \frac{a\, b}{2} \label{area} 
\end{eqnarray}

One can solve the quadratic for $r$ or read off from the figure 
that $(a-r) + (b-r) = c$. Solving this last equation for $r$ gives:
\begin{eqnarray}
  r & = & \frac{a + b - c}{2} \label{radius}
\end{eqnarray}

We now consider primitive Pythagorean triangles -- right 
triangles with integer sides in {\em reduced form\/}; meaning, they have no common factors.
In particular, we are interested in so-called primitive Pythagorean triples,
$(a,b,c)$ -- the lengths of the sides of primitive Pythagorean triangles.

What can we say about the even or oddness of the sides when the sides have no 
common factors? 

By the Pythagorean formula we know that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Using this we can 
reduce the combinations to the following:%
\footnote{We list a few facts to explain this and what follows next:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{$E \pm E = E$; $ E \times E = E$;}
    \item{$E \pm O = O$; $ E \times O = E$;}
    \item{$O \pm O = E$; $ O \times O = O$.}
\end{enumerate}
These equations are to be read: An even number plus (or minus) and even number 
is an even number.
Likewise, an even number plus (or minus) an odd number is an odd number, etc.
}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{$c$ is even AND both $a$ and $b$ are odd;}
  \item{$c$ is odd AND one and only one of either $a$ or $b$ is odd.}
\end{itemize}

Regardless of which choice occurs, equation $(\ref{radius})$ implies that 
the radius of the circle, $r$, is an integer.%

Using this fact and equation $(\ref{area})$ we see that the quantity, 
$\frac{a \, b}{2}$, must be an integer. 
This knowledge eliminates the first choice; namely, that both $a$ and $b$ 
are odd. Consequently, one of the sides
is even. Let's say that it is $b$; in which case, $a$ is odd.

Regardless of whether $r$ is even or odd, the left hand side of 
$(\ref{area})$ is even. This implies that $\frac{a \, b}{2}$
is even. Since $b$ is even, we can write this fraction as: $a \frac{b}{2}$.
Here, this product is the product of two integers (since $b$ is divisible by $2$).
So we know that $a \frac{b}{2}$ (the product of two integers) is even.
And we know that $a$ is odd; therefore, $\frac{b}{2}$ is even.
This means that $b$ is divisible by $4$.

In summary, we have deduced the following properties for primitive Pythagorean triples, 
$(a,b,c)$, in reduced form.
\begin{itemize}
  \item{One of the legs is odd; the other leg is even; and the hypotenuse 
      is odd.}
  \item{The even leg is divisible by $4$.}
  \item{The radius of the inscribed circle in the associated 
      right triangle is an integer.}
\end{itemize}
